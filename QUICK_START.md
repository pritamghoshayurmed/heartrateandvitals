}
```

## üìä What Can PPG Measure?

### ‚úÖ ACCURATELY Measurable
- **Heart Rate (HR)** - Beats per minute
- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** - SDNN in milliseconds

### üìà ESTIMATED
- **Respiratory Rate (RR)** - Derived from signal amplitude modulation

### ‚ùå CANNOT Measure
- Body Temperature
- Blood Pressure
- Blood Oxygen (SpO2) - Requires dual-wavelength LED
- Blood Glucose

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to fetch" / "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
**Problem:** PPG service is not running

netstat -ano | findstr :8001
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
```

## üì± Frontend Configuration

The frontend (VitalsMeasurement.tsx) connects to:
```typescript
const PPG_SERVICE_URL = 'http://localhost:8001';
```

Make sure this matches where your service is running!

## üß™ Testing the Service

### Test Signal Quality Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/test/signal-quality ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"frames\": []}"
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```
