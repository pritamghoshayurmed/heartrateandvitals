# PPG Integration Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
1. **Connection Refused Error**: PPG backend service (port 8001) was not running
2. **Unmeasurable Vitals**: Frontend was trying to measure vitals that PPG cannot measure
3. **Poor Error Messages**: Generic "Failed to fetch" errors without clear instructions

## What PPG Technology Can Actually Measure

### ‚úÖ Accurately Measurable via PPG
1. **Heart Rate (HR)** - Beats per minute
   - Detection method: Peak detection in blood volume pulse signal
   - Accuracy: High (validated in research)

2. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** - SDNN in milliseconds
   - Detection method: Standard deviation of inter-beat intervals
   - Accuracy: High (validated in research)

### üìä Estimated via PPG
3. **Respiratory Rate (RR)** - Breaths per minute
   - Detection method: Amplitude modulation analysis of PPG signal
   - Accuracy: Medium (estimated from signal envelope)

### ‚ùå Cannot Measure with Single-Wavelength PPG
- **Temperature**: Requires thermal sensor
- **Blood Pressure**: Requires pressure transducer or complex calibration
- **SpO2 (Blood Oxygen)**: Requires dual-wavelength (red + infrared) sensor
- **Blood Glucose**: Requires invasive/chemical sensor

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Service (`ppg-service/`)
- ‚úÖ Port already configured to 8001
- ‚úÖ Created `start.bat` for easy Windows startup
- ‚úÖ Created `QUICK_START.md` with troubleshooting guide
- ‚úÖ Verified PPG processor can measure: HR, HRV, RR

### 2. Frontend (`VitalsMeasurement.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added clear information about measurable vitals
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling for connection issues
- ‚úÖ Added warning box explaining what PPG cannot measure
- ‚úÖ Updated UI to show only PPG-measurable vitals
- ‚úÖ Enhanced database save with detailed notes
- ‚úÖ Better user feedback when backend is offline

### 3. User Interface Updates
- Added "Measurable Vitals" section at top
- Added "What PPG CANNOT Measure" warning box
- Improved error messages with actionable instructions
- Updated About section with accurate capabilities

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start the PPG Service
```cmd
cd d:\KabirajAI\ppg-service
start.bat
```
Or:
```cmd
python app.py
```

Keep this terminal open!

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
```cmd
cd d:\KabirajAI\aether-med-nexus-58
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Use the Measurement Feature
1. Navigate to Vitals Measurement page
2. Click "Start Camera"
3. Place finger over rear camera lens
4. Click "Start Recording"
5. Hold steady for 30 seconds
6. Wait for analysis

## Verification

### Verify Backend is Running
Open browser: http://localhost:8001
Should show:
```json
{
  "service": "PPG Vitals Analysis",
  "status": "running",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Verify Frontend Connection
Check browser console - should NOT see:
- "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
- "Failed to fetch"

If you see these, backend is not running!

## Technical Details

### PPG Signal Processing Pipeline
1. **Frame Capture**: 30 FPS for 30 seconds = ~900 frames
2. **LUMA Extraction**: Convert BGR ‚Üí YCrCb, extract Y channel mean
3. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Rolling average to remove DC component
   - Bandpass filter (0.7-3 Hz for 40-180 BPM)
4. **Peak Detection**: Find heartbeat peaks with min distance constraint
5. **Heart Rate**: Calculate from inter-beat intervals
6. **HRV**: Standard deviation of IBI
7. **Respiratory Rate**: Amplitude modulation analysis

### Database Schema
The vitals table stores:
- `heart_rate`: Integer (BPM)
- `respiratory_rate`: Integer (breaths/min)
- `notes`: String (includes HRV and quality score)

## Files Modified

1. `ppg-service/start.bat` - NEW
2. `ppg-service/QUICK_START.md` - NEW
3. `ppg-service/PPG_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - NEW (this file)
4. `aether-med-nexus-58/src/pages/dashboard/VitalsMeasurement.tsx` - UPDATED
   - Lines ~266-280: Enhanced error handling
   - Lines ~350-380: Added measurable vitals info
   - Lines ~560-580: Updated About section

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Start PPG service using `start.bat`
2. ‚úÖ Test measurement with real finger video
3. ‚úÖ Verify results are saved to database
4. Consider: Add graph visualization of PPG signal
5. Consider: Add historical trends for HR/HRV

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend Must Be Running**: The PPG service MUST be running before using the measurement feature. If you see connection errors, start the service first.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Clinical Use**: This is a research-grade algorithm, not approved for clinical diagnosis. Results should be used for general wellness monitoring only.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Signal Quality**: Best results require:
- Finger completely covering camera lens
- Flash/torch enabled
- Steady hand (minimal movement)
- 30 second recording duration
- Good lighting conditions
